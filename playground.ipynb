On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;There are seven sections in this survey. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections will appear in a random order.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;   1. Basic Information&lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;   2.

Final Questions&lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt; \\n&lt;div&gt;Most questions in this survey are optional. Required questions are marked with *. This anonymous survey will take about 10 minutes to complete.

To avoid error messages that prevent you from taking the survey, please try specifically unblocking Qualtrics in your plugin or pausing the plugin while you take the survey. &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;To begin, click &lt;strong&gt;Next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</td>\n",

On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;There are seven sections in this survey.

On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" \\n\\n \\n\\nThere are seven sections in this survey. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections will appear in a random order.\\n\\n   1. Basic Information\\n\\n   2. Education, Work, and Career\\n\\n   3. Technology and Tech Culture\\n\\n   4. Stack Overflow Usage + Community\\n\\n   5. Demographic Information \\n\\n   6. Professional Developer Series (Optional)   7. Final Questions\\n\\n \\nMost questions in this survey are optional. Required questions are marked with *. This anonymous survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. We encourage you to complete it in one sitting.\\n\\n\\nIf you use security or ad-blocking plugins, you may see error messages\\n\\nOur third-party software provider, Qualtrics, does not work well with certain ad blockers and security software. To avoid error messages that prevent you from taking the survey, please try specifically unblocking Qualtrics in your plugin or pausing the plugin while you take the survey. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo begin, click Next.</td>\n",

On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" \\n\\n \\n\\nThere are seven sections in this survey. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections will appear in a random order.\\n\\n   1. Basic Information\\n\\n   2. Education, Work, and Career\\n\\n   3. Technology and Tech Culture\\n\\n   4. Stack Overflow Usage + Community\\n\\n   5. Demographic Information \\n\\n   6. Professional Developer Series (Optional)   7. Final Questions\\n\\n \\nMost questions in this survey are optional. Required questions are marked with *. This anonymous survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. We encourage you to complete it in one sitting.\\n\\n\\nIf you use security or ad-blocking plugins, you may see error messages\\n\\nOur third-party software provider, Qualtrics, does not work well with certain ad blockers and security software. To avoid error messages that prevent you from taking the survey, please try specifically unblocking Qualtrics in your plugin or pausing the plugin while you take the survey. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo begin, click Next.   \n",
